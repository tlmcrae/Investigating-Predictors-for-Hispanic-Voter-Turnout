# Investigating-Predictors-for-Hispanic-Voter-Turnout
This project is a part of the QTM 302W Emory class Fall 2022.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to better understand the voter turnout gap in Hispanic communities in the United States. Hispanic communities are rapidly expanding in the United States and are expected to make up a majority of new eligible voters in the United States. However, the actual growth in Hispanic voters does not match what is predicted. We are hoping to use data to understand what is possibly influencing the lack of growth. We're hoping that some of our findings can potentially help reform voter outreach movements.

* AIC and BIC t

### Technologies
* STATA 

## Project Description
We will be using data compiled by Felix Oberholzer-Gee and Joel Waldfogel for their article, “Media Markets and Localism: Does Local News en Español Boost Hispanic Voter Turnout?” Their data included 5 distinct datasets but for purposes of our analysis we will only use “Oberholzer-Gee - Waldfogel - AER - Media Markets and Localism - Table 3.dta.” Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel created their dataset by merging Current Population Survey’s Voting Supplement (1994-2002) and hand-collected data. We are hoping to answer which factor out of age, household income, and education plays the largest role in Hispanic voter turnout. We will be using box plots to view distributions of our data as much of it is categorical. We will also be using a logistic regression as our dependent variable is binary.
